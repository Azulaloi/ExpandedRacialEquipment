ideas that could become systems for core

linked item entities {
	an item that while in the inventory becomes an entity in the world 
	basically a player script that on init checks if there is an item in the inv
	then spawns that entity into the world
	and when the item inits, it tells the player to tell the entity to return
	and when the entity returns the player tells the item to display/function/activate
	ex. a sword item that follows you until you equip it, then it comes to your hand
	
	!! an item that is two items, that can switch between
	ie a sword with a floating gun, right click, then gun returns and sword emerges, and vice versa
	and depending on which mode, item behaves as sword or gun
	
	the item should do empty stances until the sword gets close, then sort of reach towards where its coming from
	then transition to the stance position, maybe with a little flourish
}

linked status entities {
	a status that while active summons one or more entities in the world
	alternatively, can summon/control projectiles
	could control them in different ways, like dark souls magic orbs that fire at enemies
	or orbiting entities like dnd ioun stones (not sure how to set z level)
	it would be pretty annoying if their health bars got in the way constantly
}

entity chains {
	basically worms like terraria
	a head entity with segment entities that chain and communicate/share damage
	optionally can come apart and make new head segments
	for non-separating worms, each segment would need to copy the main healthbars,
	and keep 1 hp and only die when told by the head
	might also need custom loot drop management 
	separating worms would have health per segment
	and those segments should be able to display damage visually to make them easier to target
